BuildSafe Mobile App:

BuildSafe successfully delivers four core components: 

(1) Assessment Management with offline-capable digital forms and automatic GPS location capture.

(2) Risk Scoring Engine generating contextualized 0-100 risk scores by combining structural compliance with live weather data.

(3) Compliance Management allowing engineers to define standards in plain English.

(4) AI-Based Recommendations providing actionable, cost-aware mitigation strategies. 
User testing validated that contractors could complete full assessments under less-than-ideal network conditions, with all data reliably saved and synchronized upon reconnection.
